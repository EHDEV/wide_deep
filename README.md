### Wide & Deep Learning Implementation in Tensorflow


Define Base Feature Columns
The Wide Model: Linear Model with Crossed Feature Columns
The Deep Model: Neural Network with Embeddings
Combining Wide and Deep Models into One
Training and Evaluating The Model

Train a logistic regression model to predict the probability that the individual has an annual income of over 50,000 dollars using the Census Income Dataset. Would it be possible to combine the strengths of both in one model?
